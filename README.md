# 🎨 Paintly

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based desktop application** that emulates basic functionalities of Microsoft Paint. It provides users with a graphical interface to draw, edit, and manipulate images, offering a hands-on experience with GUI development in Java.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- **Shape Tools** 🔺  
  Allows users to draw predefined shapes such as lines, rectangles, and ovals.

- **Color Selection** 🎨  
  Offers a palette for users to choose and apply different colors to their drawings.

- **File Operations** 📁  
  Enables opening, saving, and creating new drawings, supporting basic file management.

- **Undo/Redo Functionality** ↩️↪️  
  Provides the ability to undo and redo actions, enhancing user control over the editing process.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User Interface**: Utilizes Java's Swing library to create a windowed application with menus, toolbars, and a drawing canvas.

2. **Event Handling**: Listens for user interactions such as mouse movements and clicks to perform drawing operations.

3. **State Management**: Maintains the state of the drawing, including current tool, color, and history for undo/redo operations.
